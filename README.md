Karya is a full-stack task management web application built to help users organize work, manage tasks efficiently, and track progress in a simple and focused way.

The goal of this project is to provide a clean and practical task management experience without unnecessary complexity, while following real-world software development practices.

This project is developed as part of my full-stack learning journey, with emphasis on clean architecture, scalable structure, and professional Git workflows.
